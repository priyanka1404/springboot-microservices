->two services registered as client in eureka server
->Eureka server internally provides spring cloud  load balancer module
-> this module will automatically handles  load balancing between multiple instances

->in API client interface
 modify the url,instead of adding multiple urls for multiple instances,
@FeignClient(url ="http://localhost:8080",value ="DEPARTMENT-SERVICE")

->we can use the id of the client which registered in eureka server

@FeignClient(Name ="DEPARTMENT-SERVICE")
