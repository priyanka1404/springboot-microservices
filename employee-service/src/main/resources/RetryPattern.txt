#Retry pattern implementation with Resilience4J
Client----------->API gateway<------>EmployeeService(applying retry pattern)<------------>DepartmentService

# retry patter will retry to send the request as mentioned times

#DevelopmentSteps:
1)Using @Retry annotation to a method(it is calling to external service)

 @Retry(name = "${spring.application.name}",fallbackMethod="getDefaultDepartment")

2)Fall back method implementation


3)Add  retry configuration in application.properties file

# Retry  pattern configuration
resilience4j.retry.instances.EMPLOYEE-SERVICE.registerHealthIndicator=true
resilience4j.retry.instances.EMPLOYEE-SERVICE.maxRetryAttempts=5
# by default attempts will be 3
resilience4j.retry.instances.EMPLOYEE-SERVICE.waitDuration=1s

4)Restart employee-service and demo

Add some loogers in empserviceimpl

after 5s it will return fall back method
it will wait duration 1sec for each call
default retry =3


we can check in logs.how many times it retried to call and after that it will call default method
